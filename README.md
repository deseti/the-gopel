‚ú® Key Features
Project Hub: Fetches and displays a live list of NFT collections from the Monad testnet, providing a comprehensive directory for the ecosystem.

Interactive Search: Instantly filter projects by name to easily find what you're looking for.

Seamless Wallet Integration: Connect your Web3 wallet using the modern and robust stack of RainbowKit, Wagmi, and Viem.

Gamified Minting ("Hodl Spinner"): A novel minting mechanism where the outcome is determined by a random spin, making the experience engaging and unpredictable.

üé≤ The "Hodl Spinner" Mechanism
The "Hodl Spinner" is our implementation of the event's "Novel Mechanics" criteria. Instead of a standard mint, users get to play a game of chance:

Pay to Play: A user pays a fixed fee of 0.1 MON to initiate one spin.

Spin the Machine: A dynamic animation of a spinning wheel is displayed on the frontend.

Random Outcome: The smart contract securely generates a random number, resulting in 1, 2, or 3.

Claim Your Reward: The user receives the "Hodl Golem" NFT, minted directly to their wallet in the quantity determined by the spin.

The NFT: Hodl Golem
Forged in the volatile fires of the testnet, the Monad Golems are unbreakable. They carry a simple, powerful message for every builder and user: HODL. Minting a Golem signifies your unwavering belief in the long-term vision of parallelized execution.
